	<p>We can say that optimization is... <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleParagraph('optimization-paragraph')">read more</a>
</p>

	<p id="optimization-paragraph" style="display: none;">the process of making something as effective or functional as possible. In contrast, brute force methods involve exhaustive search strategies that try every possible option until a solution is found. While brute force can guarantee finding a solution, it often requires significant computational resources and time, making it impractical for large problem sizes. Optimization techniques, on the other hand, aim to find solutions more efficiently by using strategies that reduce the search space.</p>

	<p>DSA or Competitive programming? <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleParagraph('dsa-paragraph')">read more</a></p>

	<p id="dsa-paragraph" style="display: none;">is a common question among those interested in algorithms and problem-solving. While DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) focuses on understanding how to organize data and the methods for manipulating it, competitive programming involves applying those concepts in timed contests. Both areas complement each other, as strong DSA skills can lead to better performance in competitive programming challenges, helping you to think critically and solve problems efficiently.</p>
